# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub.

Right now, I'm just figuring out the mechanics of GitHub so that I can better prepare for College and Computer Science. I'm having a lot of fun so far, and I don't know what I was so worried about when I decided to finally tackle GitHub.

I just got a tongue piercing today, it was way less painful then the two eyebrow piercings I got. My piercers were really nice, and I felt bad because I missed my tattoo appointment. I asked them about having any tips for Riot Fest moshes and they were so fun because it was clear they have seen some shit. I know that in the USA, moshers tend to be way more violent and way less fun. I hope I can protect my friends with hydration, sun screen and a clear mind when it comes to moshing. The piercer also complimented me on going to Community College, since it is the smarter and more financially reasonable choice.

Overall, I had a really fun day. :)
